Hi! I am a PhD Student at [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/) working jointly with the [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) and [LAGEPP](https://lagepp.univ-lyon1.fr/) research labs. I am directed by [Julie Digne](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/julie.digne/), [Christian Wolf](https://chriswolfvision.github.io/www/) and [Madiha Nadri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KOXeslUAAAAJ&hl=fr). 

I am interested in physics-involved machine learning problem, such as future forecasting of fluid flow, dynamical system modelling/control, and robotics. I like to work on hybrid methods joining physical prior knowledge with cutting-edge machine learning techniques to enjoy the benefits of both worlds !

I received two master's degrees, one in electrical engineering and signal processing, and another in artificial intelligence. I am also an " _agrégatif_ " teacher in engineering and industrial data processing.
